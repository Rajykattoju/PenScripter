Hand writer recognition is a special capability of a human, but we came up with an idea to give this special capability to machines as well to go with human hand.  In the world with a vast data and a lot more classification technologies, we choose machine learning as our path to complete the task easily and efficiently there are many approaches to classify the writer, we are using machine learning classification system to approach this problem. In Spite of training the data from the scratch we are using transfer learning with modern image recognition models having millions of parameters. Training them from scratch requires a lot of labeled training data and a lot of computing power (hundreds of GPU-hours or more). So we came up with Transfer learning which is a technique that shortcuts much of this by taking a piece of a model that has already been trained on a related task and reusing it in a new model., we will reuse the feature extraction capabilities from powerful image classifiers trained on ImageNet and simply train a new classification layer on top, which results in high accurate results.
